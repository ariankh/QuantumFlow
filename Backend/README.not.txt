This dataset includes modern-day genotype data as described in Reitsema et al. (2022) in PACKEDANCESTRYMAP format.

You may convert the data to other formats using the "convertf" utility of EIGENSOFT (https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/EIGENSOFT/).

A number of different analyses can be performed using the appliations in ADMIXTOOLS (https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools).

The dataset includes three files: *.geno (genotype data), *.ind (individual data), and *.snp (SNP data). Together they contain genotype information for 96 modern-day individuals from Greece and Italy.
